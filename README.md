# Catalogue

Catalogue all your files from offline drives

# Limitations

- Only **Windows**, **mac OS X** and **Linux** are supported. (I could look into another OS but I don't actually use any other than these three.)
- You cannot add a volume from inside a docker container. It's because volume information cannot be detected from a container.
- Work in progress...
